# PLAN — Applying EFE beyond memory: NVIDIA as the test case

Date: 2026-07-10 · **Codex-reviewed 2026-07-10 (`REVIEW_nvidia_codex.md`) —
review decisions integrated below; the review is binding where it corrects
this plan.**
Scope: `earnings-forecast-engine` generic path (`schemas/generic.py`,
`engine/generic_forecast.py`, `generic_cli.py`, `profiles/nvda.generic.yaml`)
Basis: `HANDOFF_generic_engine.md` (2026-07-06 session), current
`reports/nvda_generic_forecast.md`

## 1. The question

Can the SK Hynix pipeline generalize to non-memory companies — and what does
NVIDIA specifically need? Short answer: the **memory driver chain must not be
ported** (it would be a fake model for NVDA), the **generic path is already the
honest model shape**, and the real work is (a) fixing two data-integrity defects
in the NVDA history, (b) lifting the diagnostic layers (skill metrics,
attribution, risk band, consensus gap) onto the generic path, (c) reporting
parity. The engine code was never the barrier; **driver observability** is.

## 2. Why the memory chain does not port

The SK Hynix chain works because each stage is externally observable:

| Stage (memory path)                  | Observability for SK Hynix              | NVIDIA equivalent                        |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| bit growth × ASP per segment         | TrendForce/industry feeds, quarterly IR  | No unit×ASP disclosure (only segment revenue) |
| HBM share / premium mix              | IR + industry research                   | DC vs Gaming revenue only, coarse        |
| Cost-decline margin chain            | Commodity cost curves, mean-reverting    | No physical cost curve; margin = mix+pricing power |
| DART quarterly detail                | Official, cached, rate-limited API       | EDGAR companyfacts (10-Q GAAP)           |
| KR consensus vintage                 | Yahoo .KS (gated) / FnGuide (P1)         | Yahoo NVDA — rich analyst coverage       |

A bottom-up NVDA model (GPU units × ASP) would require assumption-heavy inputs
with no independent feed to validate against — exactly the "looks more precise
than it is" failure PLAN_skill_adoption.md §5 warns about. Revenue-growth-vector
× op-margin (the generic path) states its ignorance honestly.

**Decision rule for future companies:** give a company a physical driver chain
only if an independent industry feed exists for the physical driver (bits, ASP,
wafer starts, subscriber counts…). Otherwise it goes on the generic path.

## 3. Current NVDA output — evaluation (reports/nvda_generic_forecast.md)

Forward window rolls from 2026Q1 seed (rev $81.6bn); weighted 2026 quarters
$89–108bn, EPS $1.94→$2.36. Backtest N=19: rev MAPE 14.2% vs naive RW 18.5%
(beats RW), EPS MAPE 46.9% vs RW 67.4%, **EPS bias −45.8%**.

Three data-integrity defects dominate that EPS number (all Codex-confirmed):

1. **Mixed-basis EPS history (measured, Codex-reproduced).** NI-implied
   diluted shares step 0.62B → 2.49–2.54B → 24.4–25.0B with seams at 2020Q2
   and 2023Q2 — data-assembly boundaries, NOT the actual split dates (4:1
   Jul 2021, 10:1 Jun 2024). The EPS column was assembled from
   differently-adjusted sources. Mechanism (Codex correction — the original
   "companyfacts is not split-adjusted" wording was inaccurate): companyfacts
   holds BOTH the as-filed fact and later filings' retroactively split-adjusted
   comparatives for the same period (e.g. quarter ended 2020-10-25: 2.12
   as-filed vs 0.53 in a post-4:1 10-Q; quarter ended 2024-04-28: 5.98 vs
   0.60 post-10:1). Naive "first/last fact" selection mixes bases — exactly
   what happened here. Fix requires accession + period + split history
   together; note old quarters may have NO post-10:1 comparative at all.
2. **Q4 missing entirely + wrong-year labels (Codex finding).** The `actuals`
   block has no Q4 row in any year, and some rows' `quarter_label` doesn't
   match the accession's actual period-end year. The 1-step backtest treats
   sorted-adjacent rows as consecutive, so Q3→Q1 joins corrupt RW baseline,
   seasonal slot matching, and every MAPE/MASE/Theil on the current numbers.
   Fix: restore standalone Q4 = annual − 9M (same accession), add a
   quarter-contiguity validation.
3. **Partial circularity (known, HANDOFF §데이터 provenance).** Quarterly
   `actuals` were derived from reported FY totals → backtest revenue MAPE is
   optimistic. Replace with independently reported 10-Q quarters.

Model-shape limits (acceptable, but disclose): constant base margins across a
2019–2026 window that contains a regime break (FY2023→ AI supercycle, op margin
~25%→62%); labels are calendar-quarter approximations of a Jan-ending fiscal
year (~1 month offset — matters when aligning Yahoo consensus quarters).

## 4. Component portability matrix

| Layer                                   | Status on generic path | Work to port |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| EPS bridge / scenario weighting / annual agg | Already shared (`QuarterlyForecast`) | none |
| Skill metrics (MASE / Theil / vs-consensus) | Not wired (generic_cli has own 1-step MAPE) | small — reuse `engine/skill_metrics.py` |
| **EPS-error attribution (EFE-1 waterfall)** | Blocked: generic sets `gross_profit=0` → 5-lever bridge undefined | small — DECIDED (Codex): separate 4-lever generic function (rev / OP margin / OP→NI / shares); do not parametrize the 5-lever memory version |
| Below-OP risk band                      | Portable as-is (band over EPS points)  | small |
| Consensus gap                           | Not wired; Yahoo NVDA coverage is rich and reliable (vs sparse .KS) | medium — fiscal-quarter mis-join AND `.KS`-specific quality gate both block as-is reuse (see NVDA-2) |
| Valuation bridge                        | Portable; elasticity remains DRAFT     | none until BVT sensitivity lands |
| HTML/Plotly report                      | Memory-path only; generic emits MD     | medium — generic branch in `output/*` |
| Backtest honesty (no-lookahead, rolling seed) | generic backtest is 1-step slot-matched, weaker than memory 9Q protocol | medium |
| Segment bit×ASP chain, margin cost chain, DART fetcher | memory/Korea-specific | **do not port** |

## 5. Workstreams

### NVDA-1: Data integrity (host — network required)

Codex-ordered sub-stages; **backtest numbers are invalid until all three pass**:

- **1a — companyfacts normalization.** New `pipeline/edgar_fetcher.py`:
  cache the whole companyfacts blob per CIK (one request preserves every
  concept + later comparatives for accession audit; concept slices as derived
  caches if needed). Do NOT share the DART fetcher body (different auth /
  response shape / rate behavior); share only a tiny HTTP helper (UA, timeout,
  bounded retry, atomic cache write) if duplication actually appears.
  Extractor keeps `start/end/fy/fp/form/filed/accn/frame`; a standalone
  quarter's revenue·NI·COGS·shares should come from the same accession where
  possible; never mix disclosure vintages when deriving Q2/Q3/Q4 from YTD.
- **1b — Q4 restoration + label contract.** Standalone Q4 = annual − 9M (same
  accession); fix wrong-year labels; explicit fiscal↔model label mapping for
  the Jan-ending fiscal year; quarter-contiguity validation before any
  backtest runs.
- **1c — shares normalization + derived EPS.** Add `split_history:
  [{date, ratio}]` to `GenericProfile` (explicit-assumptions convention,
  auditable), applied in a normalization layer. Collect per-quarter
  `WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding`, split-adjust to current
  basis, then DERIVE `eps_diluted = net_profit × unit_scale /
  adjusted_diluted_shares` at load. Do NOT recompute historical EPS with the
  fixed forward 24.49B (that would erase real dilution/buyback variation).
  Keep original as-filed EPS + accession as provenance notes.
- Fix Tesla NI/EPS (known HANDOFF item) in the same pass.
- Verification: re-run `generic_cli.py --profile profiles/nvda.generic.yaml`
  and document before/after. No numeric acceptance guarantee — the −45.8%
  bias is split-artifact + label-artifact mixed, so measure, don't presume
  (Codex: single-digit-bias expectation was not warranted).
