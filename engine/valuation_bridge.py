"""Bridge from forecast EPS to BVT DCF fair value sensitivity (+ overlay layer).

Loose coupling: this module imports nothing from the BVT repo. It expects a
caller-supplied elasticity constant:
    fair_value_delta_pct = elasticity × eps_delta_pct
For MVP the elasticity is a YAML-provided constant (set by the user after running
BVT once with sensitivity analysis). P2 work will wire BVT directly.

Two layers are produced and kept numerically separate (CLAUDE.md two-layer split,
PLAN_valuation_bridge.md §3):
  - Layer 1 (EPS-driven): EPS gap vs consensus × elasticity -> fair-value delta,
    with a band projection from the below-OP EPS band half-width.
  - Layer 2 (macro): date-tagged overlays -> a separate entry-timing/risk score,
    NEVER folded into the layer-1 delta. This is the consumer of the overlay seam
    opened by engine.risk_band.overlay_valuation_seam.

Consensus guard: yfinance .KS consensus can be ~3x broken (HANDOFF_backtest_diag
§①-B). A missing or caller-flagged-unreliable consensus holds the fair-value delta
(None + note) rather than emitting garbage.
